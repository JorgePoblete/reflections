koke's Version Control Lesson 2 Reflections

- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git adds a hidden folder to save its required metadata.

- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is a intermediate area, it offers the flexibility to choose how to manage your commits.

- How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Sending only the files that are in that logical change to the staging area.

- What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When something different from the master branch is made, like an experiment, a change of color scheme or something not
directly related with the master branch in the actual state of the repository.
