koke's Version Control Lesson 1 Reflections

- How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It is helpful when you didint know where to look at.

- How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Because it gives you the chance to go back in time and take other path in the development, like a tree you can have
multiple branches reflecting other posibilities.

- What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having
versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: better undestanding and more importance of the changes made

Cons: its more suceptible to user error if it doesnt create reasonable good commits

- Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because they have different purpouses, git is more oriented to code and development, so its more likely that one change
in one file could affect other files.

- How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

You can see the commit history and see what changes where made from one commit to other.

- How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because even if my change breaks something i can return to a point where all works and fix it.

- Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Work on a repository.
