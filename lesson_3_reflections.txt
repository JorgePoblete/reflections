koke's Version Control Lesson 3 Reflections

- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to colaborate with more people.

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?

Because other people working on the same branch could push something wrong, if Git updates automatically
then that error will be part of my local repository.

- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A clone is a copy of an existing repository to a local repository, a fork is a copy of an existing repository
in Github to a new repository on Github, a branch is a branch.
