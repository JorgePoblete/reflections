koke's Version Control Lesson 3 Reflections

- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to colaborate with more people.

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?

Because other people working on the same branch could push something wrong, if Git updates automatically
then that error will be part of my local repository.

- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A clone is a copy of an existing repository to a local repository, a fork is a copy of an existing repository
in Github to a new repository on Github, a branch is a branch.

- What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

To have the most recent updates that other people could have done on the remote.

- How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Using Dropbox or something like that, depending on the purpouse it may vary, but for a development look
Github is the way to go.

- When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits
does each approach have?

When your change is not really necesary but it could be good to include.
